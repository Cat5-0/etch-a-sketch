# etch-a-sketch
The Odin Project Etch-a-Sketch 

1. Create a webpage with 16x16 grid of square divs.
2. Create divs using JavaScript.
3. Grid squares inside a container div in HTML file.
4. Use Flexbox to make divs appear as a grid - no CSS grid.
5. Use a “hover” effect so that the grid divs change color when your mouse passes over them, leaving a (pixelated) trail through your grid like a pen would.
6. A button on the top of the screen that will send the user a popup asking for the number of squares per side for the new grid.
